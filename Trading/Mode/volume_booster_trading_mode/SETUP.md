   ```

### Method 3: Single Tentacle Installation

```

## Profile Setup
1. Start OctoBot
2. Navigate to Configuration > Profiles
3. Select "Volume Booster" profile
4. Configure the parameters according to your needs
5. Save and restart if necessary

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. **Volume Target**: Set your desired volume (e.g., 50000 USDT)
2. **Order Type**: Choose "limit" for better price control or "market" for speed
3. **Frequency**: Start conservative (5-15 seconds) and adjust as needed
4. **Amounts**: Set within your budget and exchange minimums

### Testing
Always test in simulation mode first:
1. Enable "Trader Simulator" in configuration
2. Set a reasonable starting portfolio
3. Monitor logs for any errors
4. Verify orders are being placed correctly

### Live Trading
Only switch to live trading after thorough testing:
1. Ensure adequate balance in both currencies
2. Check exchange API limits and fees  
3. Start with smaller volume targets
4. Monitor closely for the first few hours

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient balance" errors:**
- Check your portfolio balances
- Reduce order sizes
- Ensure you have both base and quote currencies

**"Order rejected" errors:**
- Check minimum order sizes for your exchange
- Verify price precision requirements
- Ensure you have sufficient balance including fees

**"Rate limit" errors:**
- Increase minimum trade frequency
- Check your exchange's API limits
- Consider using VIP accounts for higher limits

**No orders being placed:**
- Verify the mode is enabled in configuration
- Check that `enable_volume_booster` is true
- Look for error messages in logs

### Performance Tips

1. **Balance Management**: Keep roughly 50/50 split between base and quote currencies
2. **Fee Consideration**: Account for trading fees in your volume calculations
3. **Market Hours**: Some exchanges have different limits during high/low activity
4. **Network**: Ensure stable internet connection for consistent order placement
